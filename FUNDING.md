# 🌿 Mnemonic Attendance Dashboard — Funding Summary

### Project Summary
**Mnemonic Attendance** is a prototype data and visualisation system that redefines attendance in hybrid and online learning environments.  
Instead of counting minutes logged, it measures the *relational presence* of a learner — the energy, meaning, and trust that make learning real.

At its core is the **Mnemonic Physics Equation**:

\[
 A = (E × s) / c²
\]

where  
- **E** = Energy (time, effort, emotional investment)  
- **s** = Symbolic Coherence (relevance and meaning)  
- **c²** = Connection² (depth of relational trust and containment)  
- **A** = Attendance Resonance — a measure of integrated presence

This transforms attendance from a compliance metric into a living indicator of **engagement, belonging, and learning health**.

### The Need
Across the UK and globally, online and hybrid schools are struggling to demonstrate *meaningful attendance* within regulatory frameworks that were designed for physical classrooms.  
Current digital registers track clicks, not connection.

Local Authorities, SEND and EOTAS learners, and alternative provisions require new tools that can:
- Evidence participation beyond log-in data  
- Reflect trauma-informed and neurodivergent learning patterns  
- Build trust between schools, parents, and regulators  

---

### The Innovation
The project applies **verse-al learning physics** — a novel symbolic and relational model emerging from The Novacene’s research — to create measurable yet humane learning analytics.

**Technical innovation**
- Relational equation maps learning signals to symbolic charge  
- Adaptive weighting system (private engine) interprets engagement data from Pencil Spaces, Canvas, and TutorCruncher  
- Produces human-readable `.know` or `.json` attendance artefacts suitable for Section 7 Education Act compliance  

**Social innovation**
- Centers wellbeing and trust as core data variables  
- Provides neuro-affirming metrics for learners often excluded by standard attendance systems  
- Builds bridges between families, educators, and oversight bodies  

---

### Stage & Next Steps
- ✅ **Public prototype**: interactive dashboard deployed via GitHub Pages  
- ✅ **Private engine stub**: ready for secure data integration  
- 🔄 **Next**: connect live data feeds (Canvas, Pencil Spaces, TutorCruncher) and pilot across  
  - *The Haven Academy* — trauma-informed hybrid school for neurodivergent learners  
  - *Riverside Virtual College* — Birmingham-based online provision for KS3-4 learners
